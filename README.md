## To use
You will need a Census Bureau API key, you can get that [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
You will also need a Google Maps Javascript API key. You can get that following [these](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) steps.

Once you have those, you can replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with the corresponding API keys needed. 
The Google Maps Javascript API Key goes in the `index.html` file on `line 93`.
